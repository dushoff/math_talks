GOALS

	Describe:

		Combinatoric games

		Surreal numbers

		Where the real numbers fit in

	Stay on this side of sanity

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Game theory

BC

	Classic game theory is the theory of games with \emph{imperfect information}

	Why would that be?

NC

EC

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Determinism

BC

	Games with perfect information are \emph{boring}

		Mathematically, not practically

	Analyze the game tree; figure out who wins

NC

EC

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Combinatorial game theory

BC

	Except that deterministic games are not boring at all

	Conway decided to think about what it might mean to add two deterministic
	games together

	The result was the best thing

Review

	We define the real numbers by:

		Building the integers as nested sets

		Building the rationals as equivalence classes of ordered pairs of integers

		Building the reals as cuts of the rationals

	A lot of work, also, we're left with three definitions of the number 3 (and
	2 of the number 3/2)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

TSEC Games

	A game is:
	
		What I tell you
		
		a set of options for the Left player, and a set of options for
		the Right player

			$x = (x^L~|~x^R)$

		Options are \emph{previously defined} games


----------------------------------------------------------------------

What are some games?

	A set of options for the Left player, and a set of options for the
	Right player

	$(\emptyset~|~\emptyset)$ = $(|)$

		0

	$(0~|~)$

		1

	$(~|~0)$

		-1

	$(0~|~0)$

		*

----------------------------------------------------------------------

How to play a game?

	If it's your turn, you choose an option

	It's then the other player's turn in that game

	If you have no options than you lose

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Hackenbush

	Uses a drawing with blue, red and green lines, and a ``ground''

	On your turn, you remove a line

		Lines no longer connected to ground are removed

	bLue lines can be removed by Left

	Red lines can be removed by Right

	greeN lines can be removed by aNyone

----------------------------------------------------------------------

What outcomes can a game have?

	$\outc(0) = S$ -- second player wins

	$\outc(*) = F$ -- first player wins

	$\outc(1) = L$ -- Left player wins

	$\outc(-1) = R$ -- Right player wins

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Axiom 2: Adding games

	To play in the game $A+B$, you move \emph{either} in $A$ or in $B$

		$A + B = (A+B^L, A^L+B~|~A+B^R, A^R+B)$

	This is perfectly well defined, and beautifully inductive

		All games are defined in terms of previously defined games

	Motivation: related to thinking about certain kinds of specific games

		Also, turns out to be super-cool

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Examples

	What happens if we add games with various outcomes?

		$S + S = S$

		$F + F = ?$

		$L + L = L$

		$L + R = ?$

		$L + F = ?$

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Some games are better

	We say $A \leq B$ if $B$ is at least as good for the Left player as $A$

	Motivation:
	
		classify games by their potential additive effects

		put a (partial) ordering on the games

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Definition

	The \textbf{negative} of a game reverses the roles of Left and Right

	This has a nice, recursive definition

		$A = (A^L~|~A^R)$

		$-A \equiv (-A^R~|~-A^L)$

	We then evaluate $A:B$ by looking at the outcome of $A - B \equiv A + (-B)$

----------------------------------------------------------------------

At least as good

	$A$ is at least as good as $B$ (for Left) if $A-B$ has no good moves (for
	Right)

		This means $\outc(A-B) = $

			L, or S

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Mirror world

BCC

	It is sometimes useful to construct $A-B$ by imagining a mirror, and putting
	$B$ on the opposite side of the mirror (Left and Right are reversed there)

NCC

EC

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Axiom 3: Partial ordering

	We say position $A-B$ is good for Left, \emph{unless}

		Right has a good move

	We say $A \geq B$ \emph{unless}

		Some $A^R \leq B$, or

		Some $B^L \geq A$

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Partial ordering

	$\outc(A-B)$?

		L $\implies A>B$

		R $\implies A<B$

		S $\implies A=B$

		F $\implies A \sim B$

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Theorem

	If $A=B$, then:

		$\forall X, \outc(X+A) = \outc(X+B)$

		$\outc(X+A)$

			$ = \outc((X+A) + (B-A)) $
			
			$ = \outc((X+B) + (A-A)) $
			
			$ = \outc(X+B) $

----------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Values

	We can thus define a game value as an \emph{equivalence class} of games

		A set of games that are linked by an equivalence relation

		The rational numbers were defined last week in a similar way:

			1/2 is the equivalence class of ordered pairs (1, 2); (2, 4); \ldots

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Numbers

	The values I've defined are a very cool group.

	But not very numerical:

		$* + * = 0$

	Games have ``numerical'' value if you can count free moves, which works when
	moving is always bad.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Axiom 1N: what is a (surreal) number?

	Recall: a game is: a set of options for the Left player, and a set of
	options for the Right player

		$x = (x^L~|~x^R)$

		Options are \emph{previously defined} games

	A number is: a set of options for the Left player, and a set of options for
	the Right player

		$x = (x^L~|~x^R)$, s.t. no $x^L \geq x^R$

		Options are \emph{previously defined} numbers

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Examples

	1 + 1 = 2

	$(0|1)$

	$(0|2)$

	$(0|3)$

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Simplicity theorem

	The value of $(x^L~|~x^R)$ is the simplest, non-prohibited value

	Prohibited: if if is larger than some $x^R$ or less than some $x^L$

	Simplest: earliest created; it has no options that are not prohibited

		\ldots or else those would be simpler, non-prohibited values

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Integers

	We create the integers as $n+1 = (n|)$

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Binary fractions

	We create the (fractional) dyadic rationals as

		$(2k+1)/2^{n+1} = (k/2^n~|~(k+1)/2^n)$

		e.g., $7/16 = (3/8~|~1/2)$

	This is also how we \emph{define} the dyadic rationals: integers divided by
	powers of two.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The limit

	What happens if we take the limit of all numbers we can make in a finite
	number of steps?

	We can get all the reals \ldots

		e.g., $1/3 = (0, 1/4, 5/16, \dots~|~1, 1/2, 3/8, \dots)$

	plus some very weird stuff

		$\omega = (0, 1, 2,  \dots~|~)$

		$1/\omega = (0|1, 1/2, 1/4, \dots  )$

----------------------------------------------------------------------

DEFHEAD 0.999\ldots

	Is 0.999\ldots really equal to 1?

	Depends on your definitions

	What is 0.1111\ldots (base 2) as a game?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Ordinals

	You can take as many limits as you want, and get all of the infinite
	ordinals, and a wide range of infinitesimals

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Finitude

	Any game takes a \emph{finite} number of
	moves to play

		Induction: if I have a new game, and play it, it will take one more move
		than the option I chose

	This number is not necessarily \emph{bounded}. Given a game that does not
	correspond to a dyadic number, it is possible to take more than $N$ moves in
	it, $\forall N$.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Axiom 1R: what is a (real) number?

	Recall: a number is: a set of options for the Left player, and a set of
	options for the Right player

		$x = (x^L~|~x^R)$, s.t.:
		
			no $x^L \geq x^R$

		Options are \emph{previously defined} numbers

	A real number is: a set of options for the Left player, and a set of
	options for the Right player

		$x = (x^L~|~x^R)$, s.t.:
		
			no $x^L \geq x^R$

			$x^L$ has a largest element iff 
			$x^R$ has a smallest element

		Options are \emph{previously defined} real numbers

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Axiom 4

	You can define multiplication

		Motivation: $(x-x^S)(y-y^S)$ has a known sign

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Theorem

	You can construct division and show that the surreal numbers are a field

		Insane induction that only a genius could come up with, seriously

		Induction simultaneously on simpler quotients, and on the quotient itself

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Surreal arithmetic

	$\omega - 1$,

	$\omega/2$, $\sqrt(\omega)$ 

	Even crazier stuff: $\sqrt[3]{\omega-1} - \pi/\omega$

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Micro-infinitesimals

	If we allow values that aren't numbers, we have infinitesimals that are smaller than the smallest infinitesimal numbers

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Nimbers

	We can define neutral games by identifying options for Left and Right

	This is the theory of Nim values

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Hot games

	Hot games are games where there can be a positive value to moving

	Example: domineering

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Conclusion

	We can define a bewildering array of games with a simple, recursive
	definition

	By defining addition, we can chop these into values, which form a group
	under sensible game addition

	By recursively requiring making a move to have a cost, we can chop these
	further into numbers, which contain the reals, the infinite ordinals and a
	consistent set of infitesimals

		These surreal numbers form a field

	There are also interesting game values that are \emph{not} numbers

	Game values are the best thing
